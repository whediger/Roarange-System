# Roarange-System
The pdf is an article about a computer created out of logic circuits inspired by
Morris M. Manno's theoretical computer the Mano Machine.

Wiki about Morris M. Mano's Mano Machine: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mano_machine>

## Summary 
Two friends and I took a theoretical computer as described by _Morris M. Mano_ and brought it to 
life. As a result we were published in The Journal of Computing in Small Colleges and Universities
and presented our project during the CCSC: Rocky Mountain Conference as a tool to help teach future
students about computer architecture.
We also named it Roarange to create a word that rymes with orange.

## My contribution
I initiated the project by gaining permission for a multi-person project and finding people to help. 
My inspiration was to learn how computers _actually work_. I designed as much of the CPU and ALU as
reasonably possible in the time given out of logic gates such as AND, OR, NAND and NORs. This is why 
the article states "we could have used fewer circuits." But I wanted to do as much as I could from 
scratch, that was the whole point. The command set was also implemented in our own logic and I integrated
an LCD display to have some form of output. I lived at and had pizzas delivered to the computer lab
for several weeks to accomplish this. Our biggest challenge/accomplishment was doing something 
we were not sure was possible.
